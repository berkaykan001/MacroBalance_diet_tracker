# MacroBalance - Macro Calculator Mobile App

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT RULES

**READ THESE RULES BEFORE EVERY SESSION:**

1. **NEVER commit or push changes** until explicitly asked by the user
2. **NEVER build the app** until explicitly asked by the user
3. **ALWAYS update current_bugs.md** whenever fixing bugs or encountering new issues
4. **Project Status**: Development is COMPLETE - we are in DEBUGGING PHASE only
5. **Keep this file up to date**: There isnt much left to do, but if there is new information that might be important to be known, include them here.

## Project Overview

MacroBalance is a React Native mobile application that calculates exact food portions (in grams) needed to meet specific macro targets for each meal. The app features automatic optimization - when a user adjusts one food's portion, all other portions automatically recalculate to maintain macro targets.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Input**: Macro targets (protein, carbs, fat) + selected foods
- **Output**: Exact portion sizes in grams for each food
- **Magic**: Real-time automatic optimization when any portion is adjusted

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 54
- **Runtime**: Expo Go / APK builds
- **State Management**: React Context API (FoodContext, MealContext, SettingsContext, WeightContext, PresetContext)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage (local persistence)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Bottom Tabs + Stack)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated 4
- **Dependencies**:
  - `react-native-reanimated`: ~4.1.1

## Important Context Providers

### MealContext
- Manages meals, meal plans, daily summaries
- Handles data lifecycle (converts old plans to summaries)
- Provides dashboard helper functions
- **Key Methods**: `createMealPlan`, `getDailyProgress`, `getTodaysSummary`
- **Important**: Uses `TimeService` for day reset logic

### FoodContext
- Manages food database with 186 default foods
- Search, filter, CRUD operations
- **Key Methods**: `searchFoods`, `addFood`, `updateFood`, `deleteFood`

### SettingsContext
- User profile, personalized targets, app preferences
- Macro calculation based on TDEE
- **Key Methods**: `updateUserProfile`, `generatePersonalizedTargets`

### WeightContext
- Weight entries, trends, progress analytics
- **Key Methods**: `addWeight`, `getWeightTrend`, `getWeightProgress`

## Critical Dependencies

### TimeService
- **Location**: `src/services/TimeService.js`
- **Purpose**: Manages custom day reset hour (default 4 AM)
- **Used by**: MealContext, HomeScreen, WeeklyCheckService
- **Important**: Singleton instance - must be imported correctly
- **Common Issue**: Missing import causes "Property 'TimeService' doesn't exist" error

### React Native Reanimated 4
- **Package**: `react-native-reanimated` ~4.1.1
- **Required Peer Dependency**: `react-native-worklets` (NOT `react-native-worklets-core`)
- **Babel Plugin**: `react-native-reanimated/plugin` (in babel.config.js)
- **Common Issue**: Wrong worklets package causes bundling errors

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start                   # Start Expo dev server
npx expo start --tunnel     # Start with tunnel (for mobile testing)
npx expo start --clear      # Clear cache and start

# Testing
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report

# Debugging
# Check Expo Go logs for runtime errors
# Check Metro bundler logs for bundling errors
# Use React DevTools for component inspection
```

## Recent Critical Fixes

### Session 2025-01-20: Reanimated 4 Compatibility
**Problem 1**: Babel bundling error - "Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'"
- **Cause**: Had `react-native-worklets-core` (by Margelo) instead of `react-native-worklets` (by Software Mansion)
- **Fix**: Installed correct package `react-native-worklets@^0.6.1`

**Problem 2**: Runtime crash - "Property 'TimeService' doesn't exist"
- **Cause**: MealContext used `TimeService` but didn't import it
- **Fix**: Added `import TimeService from '../services/TimeService'` to MealContext.js line 4

**Commit**: `6027d5c` - "fix: Resolve bundling and runtime errors for Reanimated 4 compatibility"

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Start Session**: Read CLAUDE.md and current_bugs.md
2. **Encounter Bug**: Add to current_bugs.md immediately
3. **Fix Bug**: Update current_bugs.md with solution
4. **Test Fix**: Verify app works before marking bug as resolved
5. **Document**: Keep current_bugs.md updated throughout session
6. **WAIT for user**: Do NOT commit/push until user explicitly asks

## Common Bug Patterns

### Import Errors
- Missing service imports (especially TimeService)
- Wrong package imports (worklets-core vs worklets)

### Context Errors
- Using context before provider is mounted
- Missing context imports
- Circular dependencies between contexts

### Runtime Crashes
- Undefined property access (use optional chaining)
- AsyncStorage null values (always check before JSON.parse)
- Date parsing issues (always validate date strings)

### Bundling Errors
- Missing dependencies in package.json
- Babel plugin misconfiguration
- Metro cache issues (fix with --clear flag)

## Key Algorithms

### Macro Optimization (`calculationService.js`)
```javascript
// When user adjusts one food's portion:
1. Calculate current total macros
2. Calculate deviation from targets
3. Distribute deviation across other foods proportionally
4. Apply constraints (10g-500g range)
5. Return optimized portions
```

### Data Lifecycle (`MealContext.js`)
```javascript
// Automatic cleanup (runs daily):
1. Meal plans < 7 days old: Keep as-is
2. Meal plans > 7 days old: Convert to daily summaries
3. Daily summaries < 90 days old: Keep
4. Daily summaries > 90 days old: Delete
```

## Notes for Claude

- Project is COMPLETE - only debugging and bug fixes
- Always update current_bugs.md when working on issues
- Never commit/push without explicit user permission
- Never build without explicit user permission
- All core features are implemented and working
- Focus on fixing bugs, not adding features (unless explicitly asked)
- Check current_bugs.md at start of every session for context
